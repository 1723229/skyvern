### TaskBlock

The magic block. Skyvern navigates through the websites to take actions and/or extract information.

Example block:
```
- block_type: task
      label: login
      parameter_keys:
        - credentials
      url: website_url
      navigation_goal: >-
        If you're not on the login page, navigate to login page and login using
        the credentials given. First, take actions on promotional popups or cookie prompts that could prevent taking other action on the web page. If you fail to login to find the login page or can't login after several trials, terminate. If login is
        completed, you're successful. 
      data_extraction_goal: >-
        Extract anything for the sake of this demo
      error_code_mapping:
        stuck_with_popups: terminate and return this error if you can't close popups after several tries and can't take the necessary actions on the website because there is a blocking popup on the page
        failed_to_login: terminate and return this error if you fail logging in to the page
```

### ForLoopBlock
Iterate over something such as a CSV or the output of a previous block. The blocks nedted under `loop_blocks` are the blocks that will be repeated for each entry in the

```
- block_type: for_loop
      label: iterate_over_order_ids
      loop_over_parameter_key: order_ids
      continue_on_failure: true
      loop_blocks:
        - block_type: task
          label: download_invoice_for_order
          complete_on_download: true
          continue_on_failure: true
          parameter_keys:
            - order_id
          url: order_history_url
          navigation_goal: >-
            Download the invoice of the order with the given order ID. 
            Make sure to download the invoice for the given order id. 
            If the element tree doesn't have a matching order id, check the screenshots. 
            Complete if you have successfully downloaded the invoice according to action history, if you were able to download it, you'll see download_triggered=True for the last step. 
            If you don't see a way to download an invoice, navigate to the order page if possible. 
            If there's no way to download an invoice terminate. 
            If the text suggests printing, you can assume you can download it. 
            Return click action with download=True if you want to trigger a download.
          error_code_mapping:
            not_possible_to_download_invoice: return this error if the website doesn't allow downloading/viewing invoices
            cant_solve_captcha: return this error if captcha isn't solved after multiple retries
```

### CodeBlock
This block executes user-defined Python code within our execution environment. Itâ€™s able to take parameters as input and transform them based on a certain specification.

In addition to running simple code snippets, CodeBlock allows you to:
- execute asynchronous code
- control your browser page inside Skyvern

**Example Block**

```json
- block_type: code
  label: calculate_percentage_diff
  parameter_keys:
    - alibaba_price
    - amazon_price
  code: |
    if amazon_price["unitPrice"] and alibaba_price["unitPrice"]:
        result = 1.0 * (alibaba_price["unitPrice"] - amazon_price["unitPrice"]) / amazon_price["unitPrice"]
    else:
        result = None
  output_parameter_key: price_diff_percentage
```

**Example Block with Browser Control**

```json
- block_type: code
  label: get_tab_details
  code: |
    print("Getting tab details")
    result = {
        "url": skyvern_page.url,
        "title": await skyvern_page.title()
    }
    print("Got details:", result)
    print("Now I want to see a cat")
    await skyvern_page.goto("https://cataas.com/cat")
```


### TextPromptBlock

Do a custom OpenAI query as a part of your workflow

```
- block_type: text_prompt
  label: generate_new_title
  parameter_keys:
    - alibaba_title
    - amazon_title
  llm_key: OPENAI_GPT4O
  prompt: >
    You're given two e-commerce product titles. Use both and generate a
    better one.

      Title 1: {{ alibaba_title }}
      Title 2: {{ amazon_title }}
  output_parameter_key: new_title
```

### DownloadToS3Block
